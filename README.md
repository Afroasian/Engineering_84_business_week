## Questions

- Question 1: What is Agile and the benefit of implementing it?
- Answer: Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches. Instead of betting everything on a "big bang" launch, an agile team delivers work in small, but consumable, increments.
Some benefits of implementing it would include the ability to find problems and create solutions quickly and efficiently due to the fact that it is iterative. It is also 
          flexible, this allows project teams to respond to customer reaction and constantly improve the product.

- Answer: SCRUM describes a set of meetings, tools and roles that work together to help teams structure and manage their work. The main questions asked in the meetings are
          What did you do yesterday?, What are you going to do today?, Are there any impediments on the way?. Increased ability to manage changing priorities. The benefits of 
          implementing SCRUM is that it gives better visibility into projects, as well as helping teams to complete deliverables quickly and efficiently. There is more Transparency 
          so everyone can know what is happening. There is also the ability to check your progress towards a goal. There are many SCRUM Frameworks online with the one im currently using being Trello.

- Question 6: What is DML?
- Answer: DML stands for Data Manipulation Language, this is used for selecting, inserting, updating and deleting data in a database.

- Question 7: What is DDL?
- Answer: DDL stands for Data Definition Language, this is used for creating, altering, droping and truncating tables in a database.

- Question 8: What is DCL?

- Question 10: What is normalization?
- Answer: Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database. This includes creating tables and establishing relationships between those tables according to rules designed both to protect the data and to make the database more flexible by eliminating redundancy and inconsistent dependency.

- Question 11: What is 1NF? 
- Answer: 1NF is the first normal form and is used when there is duplicated data e.g Dept(Sales, finance    sales, finance, devops) so that each attribute contains only atomic (indivisible) values

- Question 12: What is 2NF?
- Answer: 2NF is the 2nd normal form, second normal form is used when the following two requirements are met: It is in first normal form. It does not have any non-prime attribute that is functionally dependent on any proper subset of any candidate key of the relation.

- Question 13: What is 3NF?
- Answer: 3NF is the 3rd normal form, 3rd  normal form is used when the following two requirements are met: It is in second normal form. It does not have transitive dependency.

## Object Orientated Programing

- Question 14: What is OOP and why should we use it?
- Answer: OOPS refer to Object-Oriented Programming system in which programs are treated as a collection of objects. Each object is nothing but an example of a class.

- Question 15:what are the basic concepts of OOP?
- Answer: The basic concepts of OOP are Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism and Abstraction. Would you like me to explain these concepts?

- Question 16: What is Abstraction?
- Answer: Abstraction is an OOPs approach to construct the structure of the real-world objects. During the construction, only the general states and behaviours are taken, and more specific states and actions are left aside for the implementers. An example of this is when i go to make coffee with a coffee machine. I need to know how to use the coffee machine to make coffee, i need to provide water and coffee beans, switch it on and select the kind of coffee i want to get. But what i dont't need to know is how the coffee machine is working internally to brew the coffee. So i aspects such as the iedal temperature of the water would be left aside for the implementers.

- Question 17: What is Encapsulation?
- Answer: Encapsulation is an OOPs theory to create and define the restrictions and permissions of an object and its member variable and methods. These are set as classes.

- Question 18:
- Answer

- Question 19: What is Polymorphism?
- Answer:  Polymorphism means same function name (but different signatures) being used for different types. An example of this is in Cars, two different types of cars can inherit the attributes of the parent class in this case being general cars such as doors, windows, fuel. Two diffent types of cars that have inherited these attributes could both have different types of wheels, doors etc on them. 

- Question 20: What is an API?
- API stands for Application Programming Interface. An API is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. In other words, an API is the messenger that delivers your request to the provider that you're requesting it from and then delivers the response back to you.

- Question 21: What is MVC?
- MVC stands for Model, View, and Controller. MVC separates an application into three components - Model, View, and Controller.

Model: Model represents the shape of the data. A class in C# is used to describe a model. Model objects store data retrieved from the database.

Model represents the data.

View: View in MVC is a user interface. View display model data to the user and also enables them to modify them. View in ASP.NET MVC is HTML, CSS, and some special syntax (Razor syntax) that makes it easy to communicate with the model and the controller.

View is the User Interface.

Controller: The controller handles the user request. Typically, the user uses the view and raises an HTTP request, which will be handled by the controller. The controller processes the request and returns the appropriate view as a response.

Controller is the request handler.
